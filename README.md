## Usage

Once the program is set up, run the Python script to start the calculator. Here are the available operations:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Addition: `+`
  - Subtraction: `-`
  - Multiplication: `*`
  - Division: `/`
  - Floor Division: `//`
  - Percentage: `%`
  - Remainder: `r`

- **Advanced Operations**:
  - Square: `square`
  - Square Root: `sqrt`
  - Cube: `cube`
  - Cube Root: `cbrt`
  - Factorial: `!`
  - Exponentiation: `power`

- **Mathematical Functions**:
  - Prime Check: `prime`
  - Reciprocal: `reciprocal`
  - Greatest Common Divisor: `GCD`
  - Least Common Multiple: `LCM`

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the calculator:

```bash
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the operation to perform: +
Enter the second number: 10
5 + 10 = 15.0
